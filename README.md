# Sentimental-analysis-of-tweets
The apointment of Graham Potter as the new Chelsea head coach caused a mixed reaction amongst the fan base on Twitter.
Graham Potter trended some days to his appointmnet and some days afterwards.
As a Chelsea fan this pushed me to extract data within this timeframe to analyse and visulaise the reactions of the fanbase with respect to the new coach.
Tweets between 29th August and 11th September 2022 of Graham Potter(Chelse Head Coach) were extracted and cleaned using Python.
Sentimental analysis was performed on each tweet to determine its highest sentiment label score.  Either Negative, Positive or Neutral.
The result was used to create a visualisation in tableau.
